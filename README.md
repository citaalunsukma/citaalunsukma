# 👋 Hi, I'm Cita Hening Alun Sukma

I have a **diverse background** in **strategic planning**, **growth & campaign management**, **event operations**, and **ticketing analytics**. In my roles, I have collaborated with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to convert business data into actionable strategies — supporting initiatives such as revenue optimization, campaign planning, and sales performance tracking.

I primarily work in **Excel and Google Sheets** for dashboards and day-to-day tracking, while using **SQL** and **Python** for automation and deeper analysis. I also build interactive data visualizations using **Tableau** to support executive decision-making and investor reporting.

This portfolio presents a selection of projects that reflect my ability to leverage data in solving real-world business problems through both analytical thinking with practical execution.
